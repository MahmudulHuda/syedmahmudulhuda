# About me
I received a B.Sc in Information and Communication Engineering from the Bangladesh University of Professionals (BUP) in the year 2020. He has worked as an Intern in the Product and Technology Division at bKash Limited. He is currently working as a Quality Control Specialist at SuperAnnotate AI, where he has been working with various companies, and their data to implement ML products for different sectors such as business, agriculture, healthcare, and LLM. His research interests include artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, and IoT.

### Work Experience
**Quality Control Specialist @ SuperAnnotate (_November 2022 - Present_)**
-  Worked as the lead on projects for multiple international clients, like IBM and Wayve, and ensured greater than 90% accuracy.

- Prepared budget reports for the clients using the platform analytics and MS tools.
-Had a cross-cultural and efficient work experience collaborating with the Armenian team.
- Simultaneously worked on different projects, embracing the best practices.
- Provided training to the service providers from different parts of the world with the project instructions.
- Maintained the data quality and production velocity meeting every deadline and reporting daily feedback.
-  Implemented clients’ requirements by analyzing client-specific instructions collaboratively with the other team members.
- Worked on maintaining communication through online meetings with Armenian colleagues. 
- Prepared SoW (Statement of Work) after having the budget and services discussed with the clients and the service providers. 
- Led a team of 6 Quality Control Associates in the high-priority project of Wayve helping them implement self-driving vehicles. 
- Investigated production time taken for folders of data, so that time spent on production is congruent with the budget, with Platform Analytics and Insights.


**bNext Intern @ bKash Limited (_June 2022 - October 2022_)**
- Executed IT Asset Cycle as per company policy which consisted of Planning, Acquisition, Deployment, 
Maintenance and Disposal.

- Worked as an integral part in massive projects that included assets of bKash throughout Bangladesh, e.g., Auction project, Admin asset Tag Project.
- Kept track of the newer IT assets using the enterprise tool, also known as Manage Engine, daily.
- Managed and supervised IT Asset transfer during massive office shift from HQ to other new offices in SKS and RAOWA.
- Deployed inventory procedures working with the team.
- Partnered with internal teams to execute chores of IT Support.
- Prepared ad-hoc reports and presentations as needed, e.g., half-yearly performance reports of the Enterprise IT Support unit employees.
- Planned the asset disposal procedure with the selected vendor and supervised the disposal of assets.


### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
